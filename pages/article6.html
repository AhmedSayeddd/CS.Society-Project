            Aspiring DevOps professionals often wonder which language they
            should learn to pursue their career. While there are many languages
            to choose from, it’s important to focus on languages that are
            relevant to the DevOps ecosystem. In this article, we will discuss
            the two categories of programming and shell languages and recommend
            a few of the most ubiquitous languages for DevOps practitioners.
          </p>
          <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
          <p>
            There are many programming languages available, but not all of them
            are relevant to DevOps. My personal recommendation would be to pick
            either Python or Go. Both languages have different advantages and
            use cases, but they are both widely used in the DevOps community.
          </p>
          <h2>Python</h2>
          <p>
            Python is a high-level, interpreted language that is popular for a
            wide range of use cases in the DevOps ecosystem. Python is supported
            on almost every system and is cross-platform, making it a versatile
            language to learn. Python can be used to create scripts and to
            perform both automation and development tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is useful for various DevOps tools, such as configuration
            management and package management tools like Ansible and SaltStack.
            It is also used to create command-line interfaces like the Azure CLI
            and AWS CLI. Another advantage of Python is that it is easy to learn
            compared to other programming languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to learn Python, focus on Python 3 since Python 2 is set
            to be retired at the end of January 2020. A great resource to get
            started with automating tasks with Python is the book ”Automate the
            Boring Stuff.”
          </p>
          <h2>Go</h2>
          <p>
            Go is an open-source programming language published by Google in
            2009. Initially, it was designed with the networking and distributed
            systems in mind. However, Go quickly became a popular language in
            the DevOps space, especially for container technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kubernetes, Docker, and other container technologies are all written
            in Go. When developing and understanding these tools, Go is an
            essential language to learn. Additionally, Go is concurrent and has
            garbage collection, making it a popular language for building
            scalable systems.
          </p>
          <h2>Shell Languages</h2>
          <p>
            Shell languages are crucial for DevOps practitioners since they
            provide a way to automate tasks and run scripts. My personal
            recommendation would be to pick either Bash or PowerShell Core. Bash
            is something you will likely encounter if you are working with Linux
            servers, while PowerShell Core is a cross-platform language
            developed by Microsoft.
          </p>
          <h2>Bash</h2>
          <p>
            Bash is a Unix shell language that is used extensively in the Linux
            ecosystem. If you are working with an employer that primarily uses
            Linux, then learning bash is recommended. Bash is also prevalent in
            the DevOps community since many tasks related to DevOps require a
            Unix-like environment.
          </p>
          <h2>PowerShell Core</h2>
          <p>
            PowerShell Core is an open-source cross-platform shell language that
            was developed by Microsoft. If you are working with Windows servers,
            learning PowerShell Core is recommended. One of the advantages of
            using PowerShell Core is that you can easily translate it into
            Windows PowerShell. Additionally, PowerShell Core can also be
            installed on Linux.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Python and Go are our recommended programming languages for DevOps
            practitioners. Both languages are widely used and have different use
            cases. Python is an easy-to-learn language that can be used for
            automation and development tasks, while Go is a concurrent language
            that is popular for building scalable systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            For shell languages, Bash and PowerShell Core are recommended. Bash
            is used extensively in the Linux ecosystem, while PowerShell Core is
            a cross-platform language developed by Microsoft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, always choose the language that best fits your environment
            and will bring value to your work. Happy learning!
