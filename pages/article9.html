          <p>
            One of the most common questions I am asked is, “How do I become an
            X?” where X can be a “Frontend Developer,” “Backend Developer,”
            “DevOps Engineer,” and so on. When people ask me this question, what
            they are mainly asking about is a set of technical skills that they
            need to acquire. Technical skills are important, but they are not
            the only thing that makes a good engineer. In this article, I will
            talk about the things that make a good Junior engineer and set you
            up for success in your career.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my perspective, soft skills are vital for a junior engineer to
            be efficient, even more so than technical skills. They are more
            abstract and challenging to define and learn. They require extensive
            practice to develop, and unlike technical skills, there’s no
            simulation or test environment for it. Every encounter you have with
            another person shapes their perception of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a junior developer, here are some of the tips in no
            particular order:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Prioritize developing the right mindset first, and focus on
              learning the technical skills as you go.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep in mind that your colleagues will know you are a junior and
              set their expectations accordingly. This provides you with room to
              ask questions and not know everything.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be curious and aware of your limitations, and be brave enough to
              try things on your own and ask for help when needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ask questions when you don’t understand something, but try to
              distinguish between specific questions related to your lack of
              knowledge and those that contribute to the discussion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Learn how to find information on your own, rather than relying on
              others to spoon-feed you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find and read the documentation, even if it is not always up to
              date.
            </li>
            <li>
              Document any missing tribal knowledge and share it with new hires.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to figure things out on your own before asking for help, but
              don’t be stubborn about it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Talk to your manager or senior colleagues about a rule of thumb
              for how long to spend trying to figure something out on your own
              before asking for help.
            </li>
            <li>
              Learn git if you haven’t already, at least the basics of creating
              a feature branch and opening a PR.
            </li>

            <li>
              Understand the software development lifecycle at your company, and
              map out how code goes from a developer’s machine to production.
            </li>
            <li>
              Volunteer for projects, especially those that others don’t want to
              do.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pay attention to seemingly insignificant details and offer fresh
              perspectives on systems and processes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Realize that things are often the way they are for a reason, and
              reserve judgement until you have a comprehensive understanding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remember that your colleagues take pride in their work, and be
              careful not to criticize their work too harshly.
            </li>

            <li>
              As you level up your technical skills, focus on driving impactful
              projects and making meaningful achievements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Know how to ask for help! Describe what you are trying to do, how
              are you doing it, why are you trying to achieve by doing it, what
              went wrong, what did you expected to happen instead and what you
              have tried to do to make it work as you expected! Be concise on
              your first few sentences, so that people can judge quickly if they
              can help you or not, but provide extensive details of your digging
              to find the root cause.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read the error messages, someone spent a lot of time writing error
              handling and trying to give you useful information
            </li>
            <li>
              As a junior, it is better to freely admit you don’t know something
              than to guess.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remember that even the greybeard staff engineer is human and can
              make mistakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Learn from your mistakes, but also from your wins. Wisdom comes
              from self-reflection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remember that even the greybeard staff engineer is human and can
              make mistakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Give your full attention when spoken to, people will love you for
              it. Additionally, listen for understanding, not just to respond.
              It’s obvious when someone is just waiting for their turn to talk.
              Take a quick note if you have to, or even ask the person to hold
              their thought for a few seconds so you can give them your full
              attention without losing your own though.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you hear words or terms you don’t know, look them up or ask
              what they mean.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The above list is not exhaustive, but it is a good starting point.
            If you are a junior engineer, I hope this article helps you on your
            journey. If you are a senior engineer, I hope this article helps you
            understand what your juniors are going through. If you are a hiring
            manager, I hope you find this article useful when interviewing
            junior engineers.
