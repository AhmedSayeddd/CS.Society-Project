        <div class="info">
          <h2>What is HTTP? (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</h2>
          <p>
            HTTP is what's used whenever you view a website, developed by Tim
            Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991. HTTP is the set of rules
            used for communicating with web servers for the transmitting of
            webpage data, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc.
          </p>
          <h2>What is HTTPS? (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)</h2>
          <p>
            HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. HTTPS data is encrypted so it
            not only stops people from seeing the data you are receiving and
            sending, but it also gives you assurances that you're talking to the
            correct web server and not something impersonating it.
          </p>
          <h3>Requests And Responses</h3>
          <p>
            When we access a website, your browser will need to make requests to
            a web server for assets such as HTML, Images, and download the
            responses. Before that, you need to tell the browser specifically
            how and where to access these resources, this is where URLs will
            help.
          </p>
          <h3>What is a URL? (Uniform Resource Locator)</h3>
          <p>
            If you’ve used the internet, you’ve used a URL before. A URL is
            predominantly an instruction on how to access a resource on the
            internet. The below image shows what a URL looks like with all of
            its features (it does not use all features in every request).
          </p>
          <h3>Scheme</h3>
          <p>
            This instructs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource
            such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
          </p>
          <h3>User</h3>
          <p>
            Some services require authentication to log in, you can put a
            username and password into the URL to log in.
          </p>
          <h3>Host</h3>
          <p>The domain name or IP address of the server you wish to access.</p>
          <h3>Port</h3>
          <p>
            The Port that you are going to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and
            443 for HTTPS, but this can be hosted on any port between 1 - 65535.
          </p>
          <h3>Path</h3>
          <p>
            The file name or location of the resource you are trying to access.
          </p>
          <h3>Query String</h3>
          <p>
            Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path.
            For example, /blog?id=1 would tell the blog path that you wish to
            receive the blog article with the id of 1.
          </p>
          <h3>Fragment</h3>
          <p>
            This is a reference to a location on the actual page requested. This
            is commonly used for pages with long content and can have a certain
            part of the page directly linked to it, so it is viewable to the
            user as soon as they access the page.
          </p>
          <h2>Making a Request</h2>
          <p>
            It's possible to make a request to a web server with just one line
            <span>"GET / HTTP/1.1"</span>
          </p>
          <div class="image">
            <img src="../../../image/HTTP1.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h2>HTTP Methods</h2>
          <p>
            HTTP methods are a way for the client to show their intended action
            when making an HTTP request. There are a lot of HTTP methods but
            we'll cover the most common ones, although mostly you'll deal with
            the GET and POST method.
          </p>
          <h3>GET Request</h3>
          <p>This is used for getting information from a web server.</p>

          <h3>POST Request</h3>
          <p>
            This is used for submitting data to the web server and potentially
            creating new records
          </p>

          <h3>PUT Request</h3>
          <p>
            This is used for submitting data to a web server to update
            information
          </p>

          <h3>DELETE Request</h3>
          <p>
            This is used for deleting information/records from a web server.
          </p>
          <h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>
          <p>
            In the previous task, you learnt that when a HTTP server responds,
            the first line always contains a status code informing the client of
            the outcome of their request and also potentially how to handle it.
            These status codes can be broken down into 5 different ranges:
          </p>
          <table class="table table-bordered text-center">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>100-199 - Information Response</td>
                <td>
                  These are sent to tell the client the first part of their
                  request has been accepted and they should continue sending the
                  rest of their request. These codes are no longer very common.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>200-299 - Success</td>
                <td>
                  This range of status codes is used to tell the client their
                  request was successful.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>300-399 - Redirection</td>
                <td>
                  These are used to redirect the client's request to another
                  resource. This can be either to a different webpage or a
                  different website altogether.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>400-499 - Client Errors</td>
                <td>
                  Used to inform the client that there was an error with their
                  request.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>500-599 - Server Errors</td>
                <td>
                  This is reserved for errors happening on the server-side and
                  usually indicate quite a major problem with the server
                  handling the request.
                </td>
              </tr>

          </table>
          <h3>Common HTTP Status Codes:</h3>
          <p>
            There are a lot of different HTTP status codes and that's not
            including the fact that applications can even define their own,
            we'll go over the most common HTTP responses you are likely to come
            across:
          </p>
          <table class="table table-bordered text-center">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>200 - OK</td>
                <td>The request was completed successfully.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>201 - Created</td>
                <td>
                  A resource has been created (for example a new user or new
                  blog post).
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>301 - Moved Permanently</td>
                <td>
                  This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells
                  search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to
                  look there instead.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>302 - Found</td>
                <td>
                  Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name
                  suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change
                  again in the near future.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>400 - Bad Request</td>
                <td>
                  This tells the browser that something was either wrong or
                  missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the
                  web server resource that is being requested expected a certain
                  parameter that the client didn't send.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>401 - Not Authorised</td>

                  You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you
                  have authorised with the web application, most commonly with a
                  username and password.

              </tr>
              <tr>

                  are logged in or not.

                <td>
                  The resource does not allow this method request, for example,
                  you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it
                  was expecting a POST request instead.

          </table>
          <h2>Headers</h2>
          <p>
            Headers are additional bits of data you can send to the web server
            when making requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although no headers are strictly required when making a HTTP
            request, you’ll find it difficult to view a website properly.
          </p>
          <h3>Common Request Headers</h3>
          <p>
            ﻿These are headers that are sent from the client (usually your
            browser) to the server.
          </p>
          <h4>Host:</h4>
          <p>
            Some web servers host multiple websites so by providing the host
            headers you can tell it which one you require, otherwise you'll just
            receive the default website for the server.
          </p>
          <h4>User-Agent:</h4>
          <p>
            This is your browser software and version number, telling the web
            server your browser software helps it format the website properly
            for your browser and also some elements of HTML, JavaScript and CSS
            are only available in certain browsers.
          </p>
          <h4>Content-Length:</h4>
          <p>
            When sending data to a web server such as in a form, the content
            length tells the web server how much data to expect in the web
            request. This way the server can ensure it isn't missing any data.
          </p>
          <h4>Accept-Encoding:</h4>
          <p>
            Tells the web server what types of compression methods the browser
            supports so the data can be made smaller for transmitting over the
            internet.
          </p>
          <h4>Cookie:</h4>
          <p>
            Data sent to the server to help remember your information (see
            cookies task for more information).
          </p>
          <h3>Common Response Headers</h3>
          <p>
            These are the headers that are returned to the client from the
            server after a request.
          </p>
          <h4>Set-Cookie:</h4>
          <p>
            Information to store which gets sent back to the web server on each
            request (see cookies task for more information).
          </p>
          <h4>Cache-Control:</h4>
          <p>
            How long to store the content of the response in the browser's cache
            before it requests it again.
          </p>
          <h4>Content-Type:</h4>
          <p>
            This tells the client what type of data is being returned, i.e.,
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, PDF, Video, etc. Using the
            content-type header the browser then knows how to process the data.
          </p>
          <h4>Content-Encoding:</h4>
          <p>
            What method has been used to compress the data to make it smaller
            when sending it over the internet.
          </p>
          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            You've probably heard of cookies before, they're just a small piece
            of data that is stored on your computer. Cookies are saved when you
            receive a "Set-Cookie" header from a web server. Then every further
            request you make, you'll send the cookie data back to the web
            server. Because HTTP is stateless (doesn't keep track of your
            previous requests), cookies can be used to remind the web server who
            you are, some personal settings for the website or whether you've
            been to the website before. Let's take a look at this as an example
            HTTP request:
          </p>
          <div class="image">
            <img src="../../../image/HTTP2.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Cookies can be used for many purposes but are most commonly used for
            website authentication. The cookie value won't usually be a
            clear-text string where you can see the password, but a token
            (unique secret code that isn't easily humanly guessable).
          </p>
          <h3>Viewing Your Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            You can easily view what cookies your browser is sending to a
            website by using the developer tools, in your browser. If you're not
