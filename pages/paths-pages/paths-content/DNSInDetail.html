          <h2>What is DNS?</h2>
          <p>
            DNS (Domain Name System) provides a simple way for us to communicate
            with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers.
            Much like every house has a unique address for sending mail directly
            to it, every computer on the internet has its own unique address to
            communicate with it called an IP address. An IP address looks like
            the following <code>104.26.10.229</code>, 4 sets of digits ranging
            from 0 - 255 separated by a period. When you want to visit a
            website, it's not exactly convenient to remember this complicated
            set of numbers, and that's where DNS can help. So instead of
            remembering <code>104.26.10.229</code>, you can remember
            tryhackme.com instead.
          </p>

          <h2>Domain Hierarchy</h2>
          <div class="image">
            <img src="../../../image/DNS2.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>TLD (Top-Level Domain)</h3>
          <p>
            A TLD is the most righthand part of a domain name. So, for example,
            the tryhackme.com TLD is .com. There are two types of TLD, gTLD
            (Generic Top Level) and ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain).
            Historically a gTLD was meant to tell the user the domain name's
            purpose; for example, a .com would be for commercial purposes, .org
            for an organisation, .edu for education and .gov for government. And
            a ccTLD was used for geographical purposes, for example, .ca for
            sites based in Canada, .co.uk for sites based in the United Kingdom
            and so on. Due to such demand, there is an influx of new gTLDs
            ranging from .online , .club , .website , .biz and so many more.
          </p>
          <h3>Second-Level Domain</h3>
          <p>
            Taking tryhackme.com as an example, the .com part is the TLD, and
            tryhackme is the Second Level Domain. When registering a domain
            name, the second-level domain is limited to 63 characters + the TLD
            and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens (cannot start or end with
            hyphens or have consecutive hyphens).
          </p>
          <h3>Subdomain</h3>
          <p>
            A subdomain sits on the left-hand side of the Second-Level Domain
            using a period to separate it; for example, in the name
            admin.tryhackme.com the admin part is the subdomain. A subdomain
            name has the same creation restrictions as a Second-Level Domain,
            being limited to 63 characters and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens
            (cannot start or end with hyphens or have consecutive hyphens). You
            can use multiple subdomains split with periods to create longer
            names, such as jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com. But the length must be
            kept to 253 characters or less. There is no limit to the number of
            subdomains you can create for your domain name.
          </p>
          <h2>DNS Record Types</h2>
          <p>
            DNS isn't just for websites though, and multiple types of DNS record
            exist. We'll go over some of the most common ones that you're likely
            to come across.
          </p>
          <h3>A Record</h3>
          <p>
            These records resolve to IPv4 addresses, for example 104.26.10.229
          </p>
          <h3>AAAA Record</h3>
          <p>
            These records resolve to IPv6 addresses, for example
            2606:4700:20::681a:be5
          </p>
          <h3>CNAME Record</h3>
          <p>
            These records resolve to another domain name, for example,
            TryHackMe's online shop has the subdomain name store.tryhackme.com
            which returns a CNAME record shops.shopify.com. Another DNS request
            would then be made to shops.shopify.com to work out the IP address.
          </p>
          <h3>MX Record</h3>
          <p>
            These records resolve to the address of the servers that handle the
            email for the domain you are querying, for example an MX record
            response for tryhackme.com would look something like
            alt1.aspmx.l.google.com. These records also come with a priority
            flag. This tells the client in which order to try the servers, this
            is perfect for if the main server goes down and email needs to be
            sent to a backup server.
          </p>
          <h3>TXT Record</h3>
          <p>
            TXT records are free text fields where any text-based data can be
            stored. TXT records have multiple uses, but some common ones can be
            to list servers that have the authority to send an email on behalf
            of the domain (this can help in the battle against spam and spoofed
            email). They can also be used to verify ownership of the domain name
            when signing up for third party services.
          </p>
          <h2>What happens when you make a DNS request</h2>
          <div class="image">
            <img src="../../../image/DNS3.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li class="mb-3">
              When you request a domain name, your computer first checks its
              local cache to see if you've previously looked up the address
              recently; if not, a request to your Recursive DNS Server will be
              made.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-3">
              A Recursive DNS Server is usually provided by your ISP, but you
              can also choose your own. This server also has a local cache of
              recently looked up domain names. If a result is found locally,
              this is sent back to your computer, and your request ends here
              (this is common for popular and heavily requested services such as
              Google, Facebook, Twitter). If the request cannot be found
              locally, a journey begins to find the correct answer, starting
              with the internet's root DNS servers.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-3">
              The root servers act as the DNS backbone of the internet; their
              job is to redirect you to the correct Top Level Domain Server,
              depending on your request. If, for example, you request
              www.tryhackme.com, the root server will recognise the Top Level
              Domain of .com and refer you to the correct TLD server that deals
              with .com addresses.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-3">
              The TLD server holds records for where to find the authoritative
              server to answer the DNS request. The authoritative server is
              often also known as the nameserver for the domain. For example,
              the name server for tryhackme.com is kip.ns.cloudflare.com and
              uma.ns.cloudflare.com. You'll often find multiple nameservers for
              a domain name to act as a backup in case one goes down.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-3">
              An authoritative DNS server is the server that is responsible for
              storing the DNS records for a particular domain name and where any
              updates to your domain name DNS records would be made. Depending
              on the record type, the DNS record is then sent back to the
              Recursive DNS Server, where a local copy will be cached for future
              requests and then relayed back to the original client that made
              the request. DNS records all come with a TTL (Time To Live) value.
              This value is a number represented in seconds that the response
              should be saved for locally until you have to look it up again.
              Caching saves on having to make a DNS request every time you
              communicate with a server.
