          <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
          <p>
            Linux is a generic name for a family of open-source Unix-like
            operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system
            kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
            Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which
            includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries,
            many of which are provided by the GNU Project.
          </p>
          <h2>What Are Popular Linux distributions?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Debian</li>
            <li>Ubuntu</li>
            <li>Fedora</li>
            <li>Arch Linux</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Linux: Dominant Across Multiple Platforms</h2>
          <p>
            Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the
            Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms
            than any other operating system. Because of the dominance of
            Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux, including Android, has
            the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems
            as of May 2022. Linux is, as of March 2024, used by around 4 percent
            of desktop computers.The Chromebook, which runs the Linux
            kernel-based ChromeOS, dominates the US K–12 education market and
            represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.
            Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the
            top one million web servers' operating systems are Linux), leads
            other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is used on
            all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers (as of November 2017,
            having gradually displaced all competitors).
          </p>
          <h2>Linux: Powering Embedded and Smart Systems</h2>
          <p>
            Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e., devices whose operating
            system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored
            to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, smart
            home devices, video game consoles, televisions (Samsung and LG Smart
            TVs), automobiles (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and
            Toyota),[34] and spacecraft (Falcon 9 rocket, Dragon crew capsule,
            and the Perseverance rover)
          </p>
          <h2>Linux: Free, Open-Source, and Collaborative</h2>
          <p>
            Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source
            software collaboration. The source code may be used, modified, and
            distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the
            terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public
            License (GPL). The Linux kernel, for example, is licensed under the
            GPLv2, with an exception for system calls that allows code that
            calls the kernel via system calls not to be licensed under the GPL.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Linux stands as a powerful and versatile operating system that has
            revolutionized the tech world through its open-source nature. From
            its origins as a Unix-like system, it has grown to dominate a wide
            range of platforms, from personal computers and servers to embedded
            devices and supercomputers. With a vast ecosystem of distributions
            and a strong collaborative community, Linux continues to drive
            innovation and remains a cornerstone of modern computing
